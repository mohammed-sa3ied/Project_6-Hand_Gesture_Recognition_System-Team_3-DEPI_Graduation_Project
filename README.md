## 🗂️ Dataset & Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project is the Kaggle hand gesture recognition dataset, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.
To ensure high-quality model training, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Image resizing** for consistent input dimensions  
- **Normalization** to stabilize and speed up training  
- **Background removal** (optional) to reduce noise  
- **Data augmentation**, including:  
  - Rotation  
  - Flipping  
  - Scaling  
  - Brightness and contrast adjustments  

All processed and augmented data is stored inside the **Preprocessed Data/** directory to maintain reproducibility and allow consistent training across environments.

## 🧠 Training & Evaluation

Model training and evaluation are performed using Jupyter notebooks available in the **Notebooks/** directory.

This phase includes:

- Building and training **custom CNN** or **transfer-learning** models  
- Splitting the data into **training**, **validation**, and **testing** sets  
- Tracking key evaluation metrics:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - Confusion matrix  
- Visualizing training progress using:  
  - Accuracy curves  
  - Loss curves  
- Saving trained models to the **Final Model/** directory for reusability and deployment

## 🎥 Real-Time Gesture Recognition

The real-time gesture recognition module enables live detection using a webcam feed.  

**Real-time processing includes:**

- **OpenCV** for webcam capture  
- **Preprocessing** applied to each incoming frame  
- **Model inference** to classify the gesture  
- **On-screen overlays** showing the predicted class  
- **Streamlit UI** for an interactive and user-friendly experience  

To run the live demo:

```bash
streamlit run "Streamlit UI App/app.py"
```

## 📊 Results

The project demonstrates strong performance in static hand-gesture recognition.  
Several evaluation visualizations are included in the notebooks, such as:

- **Training vs. validation accuracy curves**
- **Training vs. validation loss curves**
- **Confusion matrix** 

The real-time detection system performs reliably under typical lighting conditions and standard webcam setups, providing smooth and accurate gesture predictions during live testing.
